				<p>Valorant is a well-known RPG game. It consists of shooting down enemies and planting a bomb, or in the game "spike", in a randomly chosen map while each player is assigned a role based on the agent they chose to play. Each agent has a unique ability to make the game more strategical and fun. The players are thought to save their points during rounds in order to buy weapons and healing packs. The first team to secure 13 rounds will win.</p>

				<h3>5 reasons why this game is my favorite:</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>It was made to be different than most shooter games.</li>
				<li>The plot of the game itself already deserves its own Netflix series.</li>
				<li>I love how it raises my adrenaline while playing.</li>
				<li>I match up with a lot of wholesome people, so why wouldn't I have fun?</li>
				<li>I just love testing my reaction time and awareness, while I'm playing, because it makes me feel supernatural.</li>
				</ul>
